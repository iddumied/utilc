This is a set of utils in C

Mainly to work with C, Pointer stuff and memory handling. Learning-by-doing stuff,
you know?

First goal is:
Implement a linked list in C with as much functionality as possible:

- init with a value
- get length of it
- push values
- pop values
- dump it
- sort it (will be in v2.0.0)
- permutation (will be in v2.0.0)
- iteration 
- take values from it by condition

Version 1.0.0 is released
-------------------------
See the similar named tag. The tests are running, the stuff is working. If there
are any problems, please let me know / send a pull request! I would be pleased!

If you want to add functionality to the linkedlist, do it! I would love to see 
your ideas!

Next steps (looking forward to v2.0.0)
--------------------------------------
There were some really nice feedbacks on the reddit I posted and some very detailed
feedback-emails. I will do both style and feature-fixes.

Fixes todo
----------
* convention / variable naming fixes 
* portability fixes
* speed fixes 
* store real data, not only pointers
