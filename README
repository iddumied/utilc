This is a set of utils in C

Mainly to work with C, Pointer stuff and memory handling. Learning-by-doing stuff,
you know?

First goal is:
Implement a linked list in C with as much functionality as possible:

- init with a value
- get length of it
- push values
- pop values
- dump it
- sort it (will be in v2.0.0)
- permutation (will be in v2.0.0)
- iteration 
- take values from it by condition

Version 1.0.0 is released
-------------------------
See the similar named tag. The tests are running, the stuff is working. If there
are any problems, please let me know / send a pull request! I would be pleased!

If you want to add functionality to the linkedlist, do it! I would love to see 
your ideas!

Version 2.0.0 is released
-------------------------
Thanks to the guys from stackoverflow.com. They gave me nice and constructive 
feedback!

What's new:
* real data is stored. That caused some API-changes!
* a simple stack implementation is added
* conventions are fixes, also variable names are improved
* portability is improved (I can't test it!)
* speed fixes are done

Note: There will be no sorting for the linkedlist stuff!

	Version 2.1.0
	-------------
	* print your stack or your linkedlist binary!

	Version 2.1.1
	-------------
	* some bugfixes. Removing LinkedList from memory was fixed.

	Version 2.1.2
	-------------
	* Just code-styling

	Version 2.2.0
