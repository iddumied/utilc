This is a set of utils in C

Mainly to work with C, Pointer stuff and memory handling. Learning-by-doing stuff,
you know?

First goal is:
Implement a dynamical array (linked list) in C with all functionality required by an array:

- init with a value
- get length of it
- push values
- pop values
- dump it
- sort it (will be in v2.0.0)
- permutation (will be in v2.0.0)
- iteration 
- take values from it by condition

To sort it is the hard part: 
Sort it with the fastest algorithm available for the problem size. As you all know,
quicksort is not the fastest sorting algorithm for problems (arrays) with len < 10
(or nearly sorted arrays, but I do not know how to check this...)
It's also complicated because there are not just numbers in the array... 

Version 1.0.0 is released
-------------------------
See the similar named tag. The tests are running, the stuff is working. If there
are any problems, please let me know / send a pull request! I would be pleased!

If you want to add functionality to the linkedlist, do it! I would love to see 
your ideas!

Version 1.0.0 of my stack implementation will come soon, if the tests are
running. Please notice: I will use the stdbool stuff until Version 1.0.0 because
it is much easier for me to develop writing the "true" and "false" than 1 or 0.
