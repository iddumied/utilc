Version 1.0.0
-------------
See the similar named tag. The tests are running, the stuff is working. If there
are any problems, please let me know / send a pull request! I would be pleased!

If you want to add functionality to the linkedlist, do it! I would love to see 
your ideas!

Version 2.0.0
-------------
Thanks to the guys from stackoverflow.com. They gave me nice and constructive 
feedback!

What's new:
* real data is stored. That caused some API-changes!
* a simple stack implementation is added
* conventions are fixes, also variable names are improved
* portability is improved (I can't test it!)
* speed fixes are done

Note: There will be no sorting for the linkedlist stuff!

	Version 2.1.0
	-------------
	* print your stack or your linkedlist binary!

	Version 2.1.1

	* some bugfixes. Removing LinkedList from memory was fixed.

	Version 2.1.2

	* Just code-styling
