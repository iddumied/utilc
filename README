This is a set of utils in C

Mainly to work with C, Pointer stuff and memory handling. Learning-by-doing stuff,
you know?

First goal is:
Implement a dynamical array (linked list) in C with all functionality required by an array:

- init with a value
- get length of it
- push values
- pop values
- dump it
- sort it 
- permutation (nobody needs it... but it's cool)
- iteration
- take values from it by condition

To sort it is the hard part: 
Sort it with the fastest algorithm available for the problem size. As you all know,
quicksort is not the fastest sorting algorithm for problems (arrays) with len < 10
(or nearly sorted arrays, but I do not know how to check this...)
It's also complicated because there are not just numbers in the array...
